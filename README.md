# MicrocontrollersG15
This is Project is made by a group of students from Faculty of Engineering AinShams University Computer engineering department 3rd year.


In this project it is required to implement a counter system. The counter system main components
are:
1. Tiva C board
2. LCD display (count from 000 to 999)
3. 3 push buttons (increment by 1, decrement by 1, reset to 000)
4. Battery to power all components
5. Power switch (on/off) to enable/disable power of the entire system including Tiva C

The concept of this system can be used in many applications. For example, it can be used to count
number of people in queue if we replace the increment and decrement push buttons with two
photo interrupters and based on the number of people in the queue estimate the waiting time for
a new person who is going to stand in the queue.
